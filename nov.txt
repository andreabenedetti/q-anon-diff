There is a global swamp. And it's getting art-of-the-dealt with. The swamp fights back and what we now see is the beginning of the storm.
Recent swamp elements under attack: Saudi Arabia [successful?]
Current swamp elements under attack: East Asia
Current swamp counter actions: Paradise papers, perhaps church shootings are distractions
Recent keywords: Uranium One, Saudi Arabia (esp. Waleed Bin-Talal: largest Citibank shareholders -> pre-chose Obama cabinet, HUMA), DNC (also Donna Brazile), Clinton Foundation, child trafficking.

Don't ask for a basic gestalt or rundown. Perhaps lurk one thread or read through the previous one (many summaries thrown around) before you ask questions, you'll get familiar with it soon. Yes, there's much speculation, disinfo, lulz as usual. Help us sorting out the good stuff.
